This is the first attempt at a system that can quickly and accurately record data for NSCA shooting events.

Authentication and Security
At the moment, I haven't focused on either of these since the application is local.

Usability
The focus of this project is to make handling data for shooting events much easier. It should be relatively easy to enter data, but there is still a lot that good be done to improve the process. 

Notes
The files included in docs/rules should not be considered part of this project and are included for reference only.
