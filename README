This is the first attempt at a system that can quickly and accurately record
data for NSCA registered shoots and make reports from that data. I am
attempting to hack this together as quickly as possible for an upcoming shoot.
I will be leaving out user authentication for the first version because it
is not needed at the moment.

In the first version of this web application, I am focusing on only the
relevant data required to generate a score report. This data includes: name,
NSCA number, class, concurrent, and score for the shooter. I will also include
options for HOA, HIC, and Lewis Class as well as other relevant information
to calculate these items.
